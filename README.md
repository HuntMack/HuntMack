My name is Hunter Mackenthun. I'm a Junior in Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State.

I'm excited to learn about how systems, code, and engineering interface with each other.

Currently working on landing an internship at a company which deals with space or a company that I would like to work for full-time after employment.

My current favorite hobby is high-power Rocketry.
